# GamBox recomendation app for games

## An app that recommends new games based on users likings

This project that I wrote in uni for my term paper. It's a catalog of games across many popular platforms that creates recommendations based on what users all ready played before and liked. The app works by calculating top liked genres and developers. After that list of games is displayed depending on this top. Information about the games is stored and pulled out of the MySQL database(dump included).	
App features:
* Sign in/sign up of users
* User profile with a list of liked games
* Dynamic top of games
* Dynamic interface
